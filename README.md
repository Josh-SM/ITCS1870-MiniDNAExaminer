# ITCS1870-MiniDNAExaminer
Mini DNA examiner that resembles the "CS50: DNA" project at Harvard University. This project utilizes a DictReader Object to read a file of individuals' DNA data and determines who is most likely the owner of a given DNA sequence based on STR counts.
NOTE: If you are a future employer and would like to view this project's code, please get in contact with me. Per discussion between my Professor and I, this project's code is not visible to the public to prevent future students from attempting to copy/paste code.
